# EL5610 Integrative Workshop  
## Siwa Microcontroller Test and Interconnection Platform

This repository contains the development of the project for the **EL5610 Integrative Workshop ** course at the School of Electronic Engineering, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

The project consists of designing and developing a **test and interconnection platform for the Siwa microcontroller**, including schematic design, PCB layout, fabrication preparation, assembly, validation, and technical documentation.

## Development Methodology

This project is managed using the **Scrum Agile methodology**.

### Workflow includes:

- Product Backlog definition using GitHub Issues  
- Sprint planning and task prioritization  
- Iterative development cycles (Sprints)  
- Code/design reviews  
- Continuous progress tracking through GitHub Projects  

Version control is handled through feature branches and structured merges into the main branch.
